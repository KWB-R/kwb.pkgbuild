# Introduction

At our research institute, the Kompetezzentrum Wasser Berlin gGmbH (KWB), we
process data using the programming language R. We organise the program code in
R packages. We publish these packages on GitHub in order 

* to simplify the installation of our packages,
* to be visible to the research community,
* to have a place where to host package documentation pages,
* to be able to use issue tracking, e.g. for bug fixing,
* to be able to use services such as continuous integration.

Each R package is contained in its own GitHub repository. GitHub repositories
are either 

* public, i.e. accessible to everybody,
* private, i.e. accessible only to members of the 
[KWB-R](https://github.com/kwb-r) group.

We keep packages that may contain confidential information private and make all 
other packages public.

# 1 GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

In order 

* not to be restricted in the number of accesses to the GitHub application 
programming interface (API) and
* to be able to access private GitHub repositories (see above),

it is required that, whenever a GitHub repository is accessed, a so called
personal access token (PAT) is passed to GitHub. As its name indicates, the 
PAT is personal, i.e. it is explicitly assigned to one person. 

You need to have a GitHub account and to be a member of the GitHub group
[KWB-R](https://github.com/kwb-r) when you want to create a GitHub PAT for you 
or one of your students.

The following sections describe how to create, store and delete these Personal
Acces Tokens.

## 1.1 Create GitHub PAT

Go to the following GitHub site to create a new personal access token (PAT):

https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

In case that only public KWB-R packages are to be accessed (see
[https://kwb-r.github.io/status](https://kwb-r.github.io/status) for a list) you
should create a PAT that is restricted to **public** repositories only. You do
so by checking the box "public_repo" as shown below: 

![](images/github_pat_public.jpg)

If access to private KWB-R packages is required as well, you need to create a
token that provides access to **private** repositories. You do so by checking 
the box "repo" as shown below:

![](images/github_pat_private.jpg)

## 1.2 Store GitHub PAT in a Text File

Copy the GitHub PAT that is shown on the Web page (the string starting with 
`d51eb` in the picture below)...

![](images/github_pat_copy.jpg)
... and paste it into a text file, together with its **token_name**. The content 
of the text file, i.e. `github_personal_access_tokens.txt` may look like this:

```
student_token_for_private_kwb-r_repos: d51eb...
```

## 1.3 Delete GitHub PAT

If the person (e.g. student) using the GitHub PAT does not need it anymore, the
access token should be deleted, i.e. deactivated as shown in the two screenshots below:

# 2 Installation 

## 2.1 Set your GITHUB_PAT

If you have a GitHub Personal Access Token (GITHUB_PAT)
please set it in your R(Studio) session as described below:

```{r github_pat, eval=FALSE}
Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "mysecret_access_token")
```

As we have a static IP address and GitHub API requests without providing a 
valid `GITHUB_PAT` are limited to **60 requests per hour per IP address**, 
you might get a error message similar to the one below: 

```{r api_error_message1, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("kwb-r/kwb.ogre")
>Rate limit remaining: 0/60
>Rate limit reset at: 2018-10-21 14:28:34 UTC
>To increase your GitHub API rate limit
>- Use `usethis::browse_github_pat()` to create a Personal Access Token.
>- Add `GITHUB_PAT` to your travis settings as an encrypted variable.
>Execution halted
```
In addition if you require **[private and public](#private-and-public-kwb-r-packages)**  
KWB-R packages from GitHub but only provide a `GITHUB_PAT` with access to 
**[public](#public-kwb-r-packages)** KWB-R packages you might get a error 
message similar to the one below: 

```{r api_error_message2, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("kwb-r/kwb.ogre")
> Error: HTTP error 404.
>  Not Found
```

## 2.2 Dependency

Install the R Package `remotes`, which is required for downloading and installing 
from GitHub: 

```{r install_dependency, eval=FALSE}
#Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "mysecret_access_token")
install.packages("remotes", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
remotes::install_github("r-lib/remotes@18c7302637053faf21c5b025e1e9243962db1bdc")

```

## 2.3 KWB-R packages

Provide KWB-R packages to be installed:

```{r install_kwb_github_packages, eval=FALSE}

###############################################################################
### Define Function for Installing KWB-R GitHub Packages
###############################################################################

install_kwb_github_packages <- function(pkgs_kwb, 
                                        dependencies = TRUE,
                                        ...) {
  
  pkgs_kwb_github <- sprintf("KWB-R/%s", pkgs_kwb) 
  
  sapply(pkgs_kwb_github, FUN = function(gh_repo) {
  try(remotes::install_github(repo = gh_repo,
                              dependencies = dependencies, 
                              ...)
      )
    })
}


###############################################################################
### Use the Install Function For KWB-R Packages for Project BaSaR
###############################################################################


#### These R package dependencies are needed by BaSaR project

#library(kwb.base)
#library(kwb.monitoring) # for configure, pathDictionary, ...
#library(lubridate)      # for interval
#library(kwb.datetime)   # for hsToPosix
#library(kwb.utils)
#library(kwb.event)
#library(kwb.ogre)
#library(RCurl)


### But only two R packages need to be specified (since these two have the 
### missing KWB-R packages as dependencies, i.e. these will be installed 
### automatically! 
pkgs_kwb <- c("kwb.ogre", "kwb.monitoring")

install_kwb_github_packages(pkgs_kwb = pkgs_kwb)
```
