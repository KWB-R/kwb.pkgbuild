```

This tutorial explains how you can develop an R package within a few hours, that 
already follows a pre-defined default KWB package style (e.g. automatically 
adding KWB as copyright holder).

# 1 Install required R packages

First you need to install the following required R packages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Get the names of already installed packages
installed_packages <- rownames(installed.packages())

# Install missing packages from "https://cloud.r-project.org"
# - devtools: functions for installing an R package from Github
# - pkgdown: functions for creating a package website
for (package in setdiff(c("devtools", "pkgdown"), installed_packages)) {
  
  install.packages(package, repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
}

# Install this package from our GitHub account
if (! "kwb.pkgbuild" %in% installed_packages) {
  
  devtools::install_github("KWB-R/kwb.pkgbuild")
}
```

# 2 Configure and create your package

Secondly you need to personalise your R package by adapting a default template 
that we provide for KWB packages. This template is contained in the R package `kwb.pkgbuild`.

## 2.1 Create empty R package

```{r}
temp_pkg <- file.path(tempdir(), "kwb.newpackage")
usethis::create_package(path = temp_pkg,open = FALSE)
fs::file_delete(path = file.path(temp_pkg, "DESCRIPTION"))
```

## 2.2 Parameterise your R package

## 2.2.1 Author

Minimum requirement: the author at least needs to geht an name attribute as 
shown below.

```{r}
author <- list(name = "Max Mustermann")
```

You can add further information such as a personal website or the [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) of the author:

```{r}
author <- list(
  name = "Michael Rustler", 
  orcid = "0000-0003-0647-7726",
  url = "http://mrustl.de"
)
```

The ORCID uniquely identifies the author of a web ressource and thus allows to 
find different works of one and the same author on the web.

## 2.2.2 Package description

The package description needs three entries

- **name**: name of the package

- **title**: title of your R package (which is automatically converted to title 
case with the function `tools::toTitleCase()`)

- **desc:** package description. Should be at least one sentence long and 
needs to end with a period!

```{r}
description <- list(
  name = "kwb.newpackage", 
  title = "My new KWB R package", 
  desc  = "My super cool new R package in KWB default styling."
)
```

## 2.3 Create R package structure in KWB-R style 

Running the following code not only creates an R package structure but also adds 
some KWB-R specfic styling, e.g.: 

- Adding configution files for: 
    
    + Continous integration on windows (https://appveyor.com) and linux
    (https://travis-ci.org/KWB-R)
    
    + Code coverage in R package using the servive [codecov.io](codecov.io)
    
    + Backup of Github repositories on our mirrored KWB-R group on
    [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/KWB-R)

- Indicates the current lifecycle of the R package according to https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/

- Uses by default the permissive [![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) 
for all public R packages currently hosted on Github (see: http://kwb-r.github.io/status/) and 
lists KWB as copyright holder (see e.g. [here](https://kwb-r.github.io/kwb.pkgbuild/dev/authors.html))

- Creates `README` files (`README.Rmd` and `README.md`) for the above mentioned
topics and

- Prepares a KWB-R flavored documentation website template named `_packagedown.yml` 
needed by http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/

Running the following R function will create the R package with the `version` = 
`0.1.0.9000` and development stage `experimental` (defined [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)).

```{r eval = FALSE}
setwd(temp_pkg)

kwb.pkgbuild::use_pkg(
  author, 
  description, 
  version = "0.1.0.9000", 
  stage = "experimental"
)
```

## 2.4 Add your R functions

Add your R functions in the folder `R`/. By using `usethis::use_r` with the 
parameter `name` = `function` an empty R script is already stored in the right 
folder `R/`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_r("function")
```

For writing your R code/functions please follow the tidyverse coding style 
(https://style.tidyverse.org/), which serves as our default KWB-R style.

Now you just need to fill it with content (i.e. your functions) and document it 
using [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd.html). 
If you have already defined a function you can add a [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd.html)
skeleton by using clicking on the `Insert Roxygen Skeleton` button in RStudio 
as shown below.

More information on documentation in R is provided here: 
[http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html)

# 3 Check your package

Once you completed all the steps above go to the upper right panel in RStudio 
and click on `Build` -> `More` -> `Configure build tools` as shown below. 

![](images/build_check_01.jpg)

Then click on `Configure` and a new window opens. Here you select everything 
as shown below:

![](images/build_check_02.jpg)

After doing so accept the settings by two times clicking `Ok`. 

Subsequently click the `Check` button so that your package is cross-checked for
possible problems (e.g. wrong documentation, missing package dependencies).

In case of missing package dependencies as shown below these should be added to 
the DESCRIPTION file.

```{r eval = FALSE}
Namespace dependencies not required: 'fs' 'httr' 'stringr' 'usethis' 'yaml'
See section 'The DESCRIPTION file' in the 'Writing R Extensions'
manual.
* DONE
Status: 1 ERROR

See
  'C:/Users/myname/Documents/RProjects/kwb.pkgbuild.Rcheck/00check.log'
for details.

checking package dependencies ... ERROR
Namespace dependencies not required: 'fs' 'httr' 'stringr' 'usethis' 'yaml'
```

This can be done using the function `usethis::use_package()` as shown below: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
pkg_dependencies <- c('fs', 'httr', 'stringr', 'usethis', 'yaml')

sapply(pkg_dependencies, usethis::use_package)

✔ Adding 'fs' to Imports field in DESCRIPTION
● Refer to functions with `fs::fun()`
✔ Adding 'httr' to Imports field in DESCRIPTION
● Refer to functions with `httr::fun()`
✔ Adding 'stringr' to Imports field in DESCRIPTION
● Refer to functions with `stringr::fun()`
✔ Adding 'usethis' to Imports field in DESCRIPTION
● Refer to functions with `usethis::fun()`
✔ Adding 'yaml' to Imports field in DESCRIPTION
● Refer to functions with `yaml::fun()`
```

Subsequently you should re-click on the `Check` button again and it should finish
without errors. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warning  | 0 note 

R CMD check succeeded
```

# 4 Build your package

Now you are ready for building your R package by clicking on the `Install and
Restart` button. A successful installation should finish with `Done` as shown
below:

```{r eval = FALSE}
** building package indices
** installing vignettes
** testing if installed package can be loaded
* DONE (kwb.pkgbuild)
In R CMD INSTALL
```

# 5 Document your package

Finally you should run `pkgdown::build_site()` in order to create an documentation 
website for your R package. Running this command will store the website in the 
subfolder `docs` within your R package. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
pkgdown::build_site()
```

Once you upload your R package to Github this can be easily used as documentation 
page that you define in the settings page for your R package which is available 
at: 

https://github.com/KWB-R/  `kwb.mycoolrpackage`  /settings
